I’m a student from VietNam and want to learn data structure & algorithms. I think it will be beneficial for my further carrer. As you know, VietNam is a poor country, the average wage in VietNam roughly $200 per month. In other hand, I’ve only part-time job (about $120 per month) and it barely enough for my subsistence . Apart from that, it's a great opportunity to learn from the professors from the world-class universities like University of California-San Diego. I don't want to miss thit opportunity but in this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.  So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I promise that I won't take this opportunity as granted and work hard to learn more and more.

This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help give me better understand and more knowledge about data structures. It will also improve my coding skill, a chance to discuss with other students all around the world. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course and give me better opportunity to work in a top-class company like Google, Amazon,etc. I have completed Algorithms toolbox course, the first course in data structures and algorithms specialization offer by University of California-San Diego, this course will be the next I want to take to complete the specialization. 
I plan to complete all assignments on time. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
