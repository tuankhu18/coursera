I’m a student from VietNam and want to learn Data structure & algorithms. I think it will be beneficial for my carrer. As you know, VietNam is a poor country, average wage in VietNam is . I live only for my scholarship (925 uah or about $37 per month).  In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.  So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.
I want to take this course as I want to learn Marketing in English.

I want to complete the Marketing: Customer Needs and Wants Course on offer by IESE Business School. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out Marketing and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
